# com.yellowsquad.assetpath

This package provides an AssetPathAttribute. This attribute is used to allow you to drag and drop references to assets in the inspector, but really use string paths for serialization.

This is a publishing repo. All basic information is in the [Development Repo](https://github.com/mdlka/AssetPathAttribute).
